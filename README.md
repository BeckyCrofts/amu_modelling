This is a first draft of a Discrete Event Simulation model using Python to help simulate the acute medical pathway. This involves wards such as the AMU/MAU, Virtual and SDEC wards.

The aim would be to open this model up to any trusts whereby users can unput their own trust setup i.e. parameters such as: Capacity, Triage Coordinators, Ward opening times etc. 

The models aim is to simulate changes to the parameters to see what difference appears to the outcome.
